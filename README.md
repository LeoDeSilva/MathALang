LaTeX.... if it were a calculator

*Its a programming language with the purpose as being used as a calculator with syntax like LaTeX*

```jsx
x = /makematrix[3,3]{/range{9}}
y = /summatrix{x}

x^{y+2*3}
/sqrt{25}
/root[3]{8}

x = (x+y)/2

s = /createSequence{2,5,8,11,...}
nTerm = /term[n]{s}
sum = /sumSequence[100]{s}
```
